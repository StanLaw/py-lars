    '''Given a distribution of data, compute an efficient basis.

    Arguments
    ---------

    px: A callable that takes no arguments and returns a 1-dimensional array of
    observed data. The dimensionality of this array must be constant. The
    training process will halt whenever px() returns None.

    num_codebooks: Use this many elements (rows) in the basis.

    sparsity: We encode each input signal returned by p(x) using least angle
    regression (LARS). This parameter, a value in [0, 1], gives the fraction of
    codebook vectors to use during encoding, and thus determines the number of
    LARS iterations to perform.

    batch: A positive integer indicating the "mini-batch" size -- in practice,
    we sample more than one value from p(x) between our attempts to maximize the
    efficiency of the dictionary.

    learning_iterations: Maximize the efficiency of the dictionary for at most
    this many iterations at each step in the algorithm.

    learning_threshold: Stop maximizing the efficiency of the dictionary when
    the norm of the improvement falls below this scalar value.

    resample_every: If this is a positive integer, resample some of the codebook
    elements every this-many steps through the algorithm. This helps remove
    codebook vectors that are used very infrequently during encoding.

    resample_percentile: If resample_every is not None and this is some value in
    (0, 1), then resample this proportion of the codebook elements. Codebook
    elements are replaced with samples drawn from p(x) in increasing order of
    the absolute sum of the coefficients that have been used with that
    dictionary element.

    Result
    ------

    This function generates a sequence of basis dictionaries, each more
    efficient than the last for encoding elements drawn from p(x). Each
    dictionary has num_codebooks rows and the same number of columns as the
    length of elements returned by p(x). Note that this is the transpose of the
    typical representation for this matrix.

    Attribution
    -----------
